# Guitar Tabs

Will publish here some of the tabs I'll be working on.

1. My tuitor, Nizam, has recently played beautiful melody of "City of the Gold" by Aquarium (BG), well known band in the former USSR. They actually "borrowed" the music from Canzone of F. da Milano. I have now the video of my tuitor and also original notes. Will try to convert them into guitar tabs as the first task in this repo.
